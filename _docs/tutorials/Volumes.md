## NTP servers with 'monlist' enabled

---

**Defenition:**  
**The Network Time Protocol (NTP)** is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between IT systems. NTP supports a monitoring service that allows administrators to query the server for traffic counts of connected clients via the 'monlist' command.

**Problem:**  
The NTP 'monlist' feature can be abused for DDoS reflection attacks against third parties.
